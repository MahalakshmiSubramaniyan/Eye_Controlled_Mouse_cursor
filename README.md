# Eye_Controlled_Mouse_cursor

The system described here presents a hand-free interface between human and
computer. Generally the mouse which used by people has been replaced in a new way
which uses the human facial expressions and features. It uses various image
processing methods such as face detection, eye extraction and interpretation of a
sequence of eye blinks in real time for controlling a non intrusive human computer
interface. It uses a typical webcam to capture an input image. Mouse cursor control
can be done by facial movement by moving the face towards left, right, up and down
and mouse events are controlled through eye blinks. A high number of people,
affected with neuron-loco motor disabilities can use this technologies in computers
for basic tasks such as sending or receiving messages, browsing the internet, watch
their favorite TV show or movies. This algorithm is used to give the best possible
outcomes of the eye position using the decision tree algorithm so that the eye
movement is detected and the mouse moves accordingly. It also enables the user to
open and close the applications by blinking of the eye.
